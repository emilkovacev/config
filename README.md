# Config

Compatible on UNIX devices.

## Setup

To install, simple run the following command:

```
$ chmod +x config.sh && ./config.sh
```

If you already have existing configuration files, the config script will 
NOT overwrite them, but will instead warn you that a file already exists. 
It is your responsibility to delete them.
